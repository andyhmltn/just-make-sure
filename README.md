# justmakesure.js

justmakesure is an EXTREMELY minimal javascript testing tool.   
I was working on a small-ish project and just wanted to make sure a few things were working as intended. I had no internet access to download a library so I wrote this tool.   
It is meant to be as easy and quick as possible to test really basic functionality for small projects.   

## Usage
Add justmakesure.js and justmakesure.css to an html page along with the file you want to test and a test file (or write your tests in your html), open up the html file in your favorite browser and see the results.    
__For example:__   
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
        <head>
            <script type="text/javascript" src="justmakesure.js"></script>
            <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="justmakesure.css">
            <!--
                include the script you want to test
            -->
        </head>
        <body>
            <script type="text/javascript">
                var a = 3;
                
                MAKE_SURE.after_each = function() { a = 3 };
                
                // This will pass
                makeSure("Multiplying 3 by 4 gives 12", function() {
                    a *= 4;
                    return a === 12;
                });
                
                // This will fail
                makeSure("Adding 17 to 3 gives 21", function() {
                    a += 17;
                    return a === 21;
                });
                
                // This will throw an exception
                makeSure("Calling plusOne on 3 gives 4", function() {
                    a.plusOne();
                    return a === 4;
                });
                
                // Testing objects
                makeSure("An array of numbers is sorted correctly", function() {
                    var actual   = [2, 1, 4, 3].sort(),
                        expected = [1, 2, 3, 4];
                    return JSON.stringify(actual) === JSON.stringify(expected);
                });
            </script>
        </body>
    </html>
